    <p class="mt-4">We don't expect you to have all of this down perfectly at this point and it might be a little while
      since you've touched full stack development. To hopefully give you a refresher, I've developed a small (optional)

    <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to drastically impact education and require us to rethink how we
      teach CS. In this project, you'll use your prompt engineering and programming skills to create an ChatGPT-like
      interface! </p>
    <p class="my-2">Here's what your final interface <span class="italic">could</span> look like:</p>

        Build a user interface to display messages in a conversation and send messages to a chatbot.

        Implement a basic (but secure) authentication system to track user chat messages.

        Log all prompts and responses from users in a non-volatile memory system like a database.

        Deploy your site such that it's both functional and accessible to the internet.

        Add system prompts to refine the behavior of your chatbot. Is it a bot that responds with JavaScript related
        puns? Or a bot interested in becoming a Terminator? It's totally up to you!

    <p>This can be a lot of work if you do it all yourself! Luckily I have some tools that can expidite your development
      process.</p>

        Feel free to ask me for some of the components I made for the frontend example. (Or use the chatbot for some code)

        I'd recommend deploying through GitHub actions with a service like Vercel
