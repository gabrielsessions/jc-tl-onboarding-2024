      Project</h1>
    <p class="mt-6">Tech leads should be proficient with a wide variety of web development tools including</p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-4 font-normal">
      <li class="list-item">Frontend Development: React, JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS, JSX/TSX </li>
      <li class="list-item">Backend Servers: Runtimes, APIs, Basic Networking (HTTP)</li>
      <li class="list-item">DBMS: SQL v. NoSQL, Schemas, Query Builders v. ORMs</li>
      <li class="list-item">Authentication</li>
      <li class="list-item">Version Control: Git, GitHub</li>
      <li class="list-item">Deployment</li>

    </ul>
    <p class="mt-4">We don't expect you to have all of this down perfectly at this point and it might be a little while
      since you've touched full stack development. To hopefully give you a refresher, we've developed a small
      full stack project that covers all of the skills above.
    </p>

    <p class="my-2">We've opted to do a more practical project instead of a "traditional" onboarding with slideshows and
      synchonous meetings. We hope this is far more interesting and helpful than sitting through Zoom calls! :)</p>

    <h3 class="my-4 text-xl text-green-600 font-semibold">üêò JumboCodeGPT üêò</h3>
    <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to drastically impact education and require us to rethink how we
      teach CS. In this project, you'll use your prompt engineering and programming skills to create an ChatGPT-like
      interface! </p>
    <p class="my-2">Here's what your final interface <span class="italic">could</span> look like:</p>

    <ul class="ml-4 lg:ml-6 lg:mr-2 list-disc">

      <li class="list-item mb-1">
        Build a user interface to display messages in a conversation and send messages to a chatbot.
        <ul class="ml-4 lg:ml-6 lg:mr-2 list-disc">
          <li class="list-item mb-1">The prompt sent to OpenAI must include ALL chat messages in a conversation.
            Previous messages must be sent as context to maintain a fluid conversation.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="list-item mb-1">
        Implement a basic (but secure) authentication system to track user chat messages.
      </li>
      <li class="list-item mb-1">
        Log all prompts from users and responses from OpenAI in a non-volatile memory system like a database.
      </li>
      <li class="list-item mb-1">
        Add system prompts to refine the behavior of your chatbot. Is it a bot that responds with JavaScript related
        puns? Or a bot interested in becoming a Terminator? It's totally up to you!
      </li>
      <li class="list-item mb-1">
        Deploy your fully functional site to the internet.

    username/password

    <h3 class="my-4 text-lg text-green-600 ">Deadlines and Check-ins</h3>
    <p class="mb-1">You will be given approximately 4 weeks to complete the project. We expect this will to take between
      4-10 hours to complete depending on your experience level. It should be more than manageable if you spend a couple
      hours per week on it. Please reach out ASAP if you're spending significantly more time on the project than our
      estimate.</p>
    <p class="my-1">You'll have a few short (10-15 min) check-in with Gabe or Ben to update us on your progress. By the
      first meeting, you should have a good idea of what your tech stack will be. Please tell us your tech stack before
      implementing your web app.</p>

    <h3 class="my-4 text-lg text-green-600 ">I need some help!</h3>
    <p>This can be a lot of work if you do it all yourself! Luckily I have some tools that can expidite your development
      process.</p>

        We already have a backend server up that handles authentication and OpenAI API communication <a

          documentation

      <li class="list-item mb-1">
        Feel free to ask me for some of the components I made for the frontend example. (Or use the chatbot for some
        code)

      <li class="list-item mb-1">
        We recommend connecting your GitHub repo to Vercel for easy deployment.

        We're always more than happy to answer some of your questions. Please don't struggle in silence!
