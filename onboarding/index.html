      Project</h1>

      It might be a little while since you've touched full stack web dev and we do not expect you to be an expert with
      all of these skills. We've developed a small project covering a full stack system to refresh some of your
      technical skills.
    </p>

    <p class="my-2">
      We've opted to do a more practical project instead of a "traditional" onboarding with slideshows and synchonous
      meetings. We hope this is far more interesting and helpful than sitting through Zoom calls! :)

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to drastically impact education and require us to rethink how we
      teach CS. They're also an incredibly useful resource when debugging when debugging code. In this project, you'll
      use your prompt engineering and programming skills to create an ChatGPT-like
      interface with React!
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">Here's what your final interface <span class="italic">could</span> look like:</p>
    <img width="300px" src="../img/chatgpt_interface_example.png" alt="Example of a ChatGPT interface"></img>

    <p>There's no one right way to achieve a working chatbot, and feel free to use strategies (for anything ‚Äî styling, architecture, backend) that you're more comfortable with or have used before.</p>

    <h3 class="my-4 text-lg text-green-600 ">Functionality Requirements</h3>
    <ul class="ml-4 lg:ml-6 lg:mr-2 list-disc">
      <li class="list-item mb-1">
        Build a user interface with React to display messages in a conversation and send messages to a chatbot.
        <ul class="ml-4 lg:ml-6 lg:mr-2 list-disc">
          <li class="list-item my-1">
            The prompt sent to OpenAI must include ALL chat messages in a conversation.
            Previous messages must be sent as context to maintain a fluid conversation.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="list-item mb-1">
        Log all prompts from users and responses from OpenAI in a non-volatile memory system like a database.
      </li>
      <li class="list-item mb-1">
        Add system prompts to refine the behavior of your chatbot. Is it a bot that responds with JavaScript related
        puns? Or a bot interested in becoming a Terminator? It's totally up to you!

    <h3 class="my-4 text-lg text-green-600 ">Deadlines and Check-ins</h3>
    <p class="mb-1">You will be given approximately 4 weeks to complete the project. We expect this will to take between
      4-10 hours to complete depending on your experience level. It should be more than manageable if you spend a couple
      hours per week on it. Please reach out ASAP if you're spending significantly more time on the project than our
      estimate.</p>
    <p class="my-1">
      We'll have short (~15 min) weekly check-ins to answer any questions that have come up about the onboarding project.

      <span class="italic underline font-semibold">Please send Gabriel and Ben your planned tech stack before you start implementing your design!</span> Try to have an initial tech stack planned and sent to us before your first check-in.
