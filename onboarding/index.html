      It might be a little while since you've touched full stack web dev and we do not expect you to be an expert with
      all of these skills. We've developed a small project covering a full stack system to refresh some of your
      technical skills.
    </p>

    <p class="my-2">
      We've opted to do a more practical project instead of a "traditional" onboarding with slideshows and synchonous
      meetings. We hope this is far more interesting and helpful than sitting through Zoom calls! :)

      Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to drastically impact education and require us to rethink how we
      teach CS. They're also an incredibly useful resource when debugging when debugging code. In this project, you'll
      use your prompt engineering and programming skills to create a ChatGPT
      interface with React!
    </p>

    <h3 class="my-4 text-lg text-green-600 ">Functionality Requirements</h3>
    <ul class="ml-4 lg:ml-6 lg:mr-2 list-disc">
      <li class="list-item mb-1">
        Design a system that serves a webpage with a ChatGPT interface. (UI Example Above)
        <ul class="ml-4 lg:ml-6 lg:mr-2 list-disc mt-1.5">
          <li>Users must be able to send prompts to ChatGPT and receive responses using your interface.</li>
          <li>The chatbot should consider the full context of the conversation, not just the most recently submitted prompt(s).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="mb-1">
        Give your chatbot a personality. Is it a bot that responds with JavaScript related
        puns? Or a bot interested in becoming a Terminator? It's totally up to you!
      </li>
      <li class="list-item mb-1">
        The system must log all user prompts and ChatGPT responses in a database (or other non-volatile memory storage).
      </li>
      <li class="list-item mb-1">
        The conversation(s) should be persistent between page loads. In other words, the user
        shouln't lose their conversation when the webpage is reloaded.
      </li>
      <li class="list-item mb-1">Your final product should be a publicly accessible webpage that users can access with a URL.</li>
      
    </ul>

    <h3 class="my-4 text-lg text-green-600 ">Technical Requirements</h3>
    <p>You are allowed to choose any tech stack with the following stipulations:</p>
    <ul class="ml-4 lg:ml-6 lg:mr-2 list-disc">
      <li class="list-item mb-1">
        Use React (in any form) to build your user interface
      </li>
      <li class="mb-1">All OpenAI API calls need to be sent through Gabe's <a class="text-blue-500 hover:underline active:text-blue-600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
        href="./server_documentation.txt">OpenAI API wrapper</a> from a backend server that you manage.</li>
      <li class="list-item mb-1">
        Avoid using Firebase. We'd like you to get some practice using other backend tools!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>There's no one right way to achieve a working chatbot, and feel free to use strategies (for anything ‚Äî styling,
      architecture, backend) that you're comfortable with or have used before. This is also a great opportunity to try
      out new web dev tools if you feel adventurous.</p>

    <h3 class="my-4 text-lg text-green-600">Deadlines and Check-ins</h3>
    <p class="mb-1">You will be given approximately 4 weeks to complete the project. We expect this will to take between
      4-12 hours to complete depending on your experience level. It should be more than manageable if you spend a couple
      hours per week on it. Please reach out ASAP if you're spending significantly more time on the project than our
      estimate.</p>
    <p class="my-1">
      We'll have short (~15 min) weekly check-ins to answer any questions that have come up about the onboarding
      project.
